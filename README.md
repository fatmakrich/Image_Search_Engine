# Image Search Engine  

This project introduces an advanced image search engine that utilizes cutting-edge techniques for visual feature extraction and similarity comparison. By leveraging the VGG16 model for feature extraction and cosine similarity for similarity measurement, the system efficiently identifies and ranks visually similar images.

## Key Features  

- **Feature Extraction**: Employs the VGG16 model (pre-trained on ImageNet) to extract meaningful visual features from images.  
- **Similarity Comparison**: Uses **cosine similarity** to measure the resemblance between images.  
- **Image Retrieval**: Efficiently identifies and displays the most visually similar images for a given input.
